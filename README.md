# Project Title: Neo Foodie

### Project Overview:
Neo Foodie is a place-based food discovery web or mobile application platform designed to make it easier to find the perfect restaurants in their vicinity. In addition to well-crafted detailed reviews on food, interaction with maps and community, the application offers users an immersive experience based on real opinions from local foodies looking to discover new food spots.

### Key Features
1. **Restaurant Reviews  **: Users can create and read rich reviews of restaurants in their locale, including food quality, service, ambiance, and overall experience.
2. **Special Food Highlights**: Users can highlight and discover special dishes or signature items offered by different restaurants.
3. **Product Price Information**: The restaurant profile lists the price details of various products, which is helpful for a user to select according to their budget.
4. **Interactive Maps**: Users can see restaurants around them on a map with location-based filtering options. Therefore, finding places based on proximity and food type is easy.


### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React for building a dynamic and responsive interface; Redux for managing application state; Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express to develop the API to handle reviews, restaurant data, and user authentication.
- **Database**: MongoDB to store restaurant data, user profiles, reviews, and photos.

### Why This Project:
Neo Foodie combines two things I am passionate about: food and technology. I want to create a platform that connects local communities and enhances the dining experience through crowdsourced recommendations. This project offers a chance to deepen my skills in full-stack development, particularly with geolocation features, social engagement functionalities, and user-generated content. It will also be insightful in developing scalable platforms to handle large user data and real-time interaction, which could come in handy when developing larger applications.
